There are 2 files:
1) company_articles_updated.xls
2) stocks.xls

**To Prof. Westheide:** please, go here to access these files: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/bbhxaxxx3ksuzbvwo6ppd/AMRsu0m5Zstv_3iCwmvs5Xc?rlkey=grlwyo6n7ap3a1fcsms4ople0&st=i4ptc08x&dl=0

The first one contains all news articles for around 500 companies (a little more - don't forget to filter later on data from stocks.xls) for the last 2 years. The sample of the companies includes the smallest 40% of all existing public companies scraped from CapitalIQ.
The second one contains stock close price data for each company, its trade volume and an industry index (that I would suggest we use as a market proxy if needed) for each trading day of the last 3 years

Both tables have an identification column: "Company code" for stocks.xls and "company_code" for company_articles_updated.xls. They were used to match the prices with the news.
