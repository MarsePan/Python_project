There are 2 files:
1) company_articles_updated.xls
2) stocks.xls

The first one contains all news articles for around 500 companies (a little more - don't forget to filter later on data from stocks.xls) for the last 2 years. The sample of the companies includes the smallest 40% of all existing public companies scraped from CapitalIQ.
The second one contains stock close price data for each company, its trade volume and an industry index for each trading day of the last 3 years

Load the data into your jupyter notebooks to see, how the data looks like and what columns are there under which names

Both tables have an identification column: "Company code" for stocks.xls and "company_code" for company_articles_updated.xls. Use them to match the prices with the news.
